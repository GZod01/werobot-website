Last year our tests were done on half a table so we couldn't tests our robots on the real 2x3m table. Moreover, our table was a bit wobbly and not even at all. But this year, we have a new venue, with enough room to hold a big table so we asked our carpenter partner, [la menuiserie Papavoine](https://www.papavoine-menuiserie.com/), to build one for us.
On this wednesday, november the 13th, we brought it from the carpentry up to our 2nd floor venue.

Next sunday, we sticked the official competition vinyl flooring material on it. It's a special one because it was both modified by [the ESEO team](https://twitter.com/ESEORobot/status/1186720300626579459) who add a grid on it and by us to add our logo. We are very proud of it :-D

Unfortunately the three part can't be aligned perfectly but it's still very nice and perfect for our tests for the competition.

We particularly thank the <a href="https://credit-agricole.fr/particulier/agence/normandie-seine/gaillon-2371.html">Cr√©dit Agricole</a> from Gaillon for helping us in buying this table.
