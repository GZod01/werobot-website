## By the stove 
Mohammed and Pauline are putting their thinking caps on trigonometry:What is at stake?Computer-aided sketching and drawing a perfect cherry vacuum collector.Ultimately the team will model and 3D print the piece.

## On the prep area
Mahé has temporarily set aside his work on the PS4 gamepad.There has been an urgent order:the ECS Electronic Speed Controller has just been delivered … with its own connecting plugs.Mahé is requested to weld so that the turbine fits in the battery.

## In the lounge
Hadrien and Aurélien are working out on a piece which will be added to the crop basket:An electronic counter.The idea is to insert an infrared sensor to the counter.Aurélien is in charge of the programming while Hadrien is setting up two sensors on a rough cardboard, for testing. Matthieu  directs the operations.

## By the windows
The cherry vacuum collector is making it tough for the team.How about adding a telescopic arm to the robot?The team has worked out that it would do less damage to make the arm swing and vacuum than to let the robot make its way through the plates and dishes on the table.PVC hosepipe,join and last,Venturi effect are to piece together.
