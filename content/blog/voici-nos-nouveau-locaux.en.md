From today, the Gaillon municipality lends us a 100 m² facility split into two rooms.
In the first one, we'll set up our work-room for preparing robotics contest. In the second one, it will depends on money and volonteers we'll have ! But we'd like to set up a computer room (with raspberry pi) to organize weekly workshop with children to show Scratch programming language and micro:bit for example.

Here's a video of the rooms (vertical way : ugly but so cool ;) )

We look forward to setting everythin up. We even already began to prepare our next context (we'll write about it in the next post) in this nearly empty room !!

We are very happy \0/ Thank you to the Gaillon municipality.
