In addition to the spreading  of the English language,the BBC has been involved for years in providing to all,and specifically in the U.K public libraries,with microbit cards.The goal is to help everybody,the most targeted ones being the younger ones,to get trained,upgrade their digital skills,design,create.
Indeed,the microbit cards are designed to turn a programme into a concrete interaction,whether it be an object or a game.

Today , the writing of the programme aims at sending messages from one microbit card to the other and respond accordingly. Alexandre and Nathanël are sticking to it !
