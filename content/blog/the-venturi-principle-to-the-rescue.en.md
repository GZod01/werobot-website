Crash Test 

Our cherry vacuum collector has been tested but it has resulted in the crushing of all the cherries : Jam is not supposed to be on the menu!The vacuum collector must be improved.

## The Venturi principle.

Damien, our curious and risk-taker physicist, has come to back up the team’s system suggesting to use the Venturi principle. If a by-pass is added to the collector while making the size of the main pipe smaller, the air will push the cherries out faster ; the depression thus created will save the cherries.

## François down to calculations and technical drawing.

Aurélien and Matthieu are completing the upgraded programming of the collector. Meanwhile François is trying to make out if the battery of the robot will be charged enough for the whole competition...15.6 minutes . A game is one-minutish so that will do.

François knows a thing or two about technical drawing… Something to do with other times – not so old -and other lads. A sheet of paper, a couple of pencils, a reluer , a compass and here he goes again. It is about drawing the by-pass element , which be modeled and eventually printed in 3D.
A serious business.
