One month to create the robot.
But we know this contest : we already lost yhere !
No way we do the same mistakes again !

We need a fast, reliable and efficient robot.

We already have worked on holonomic drive during some spare time. We'll try it for this championship.
Moreover, last year, we saw some collecting balls system that we call "harvester" which seemed efficient. Here we go then.

We're testing the harvester efficiency :

It seems right.

Some weeks later, we can do this :

We're ready to go !
