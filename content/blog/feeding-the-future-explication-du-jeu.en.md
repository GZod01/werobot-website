## The game explanation of the <i>FIRST</i> Global Challenge Athens 2024

In the "Feeding the Future" game, teams maneuver their robot through a simulated world that focuses on the complex, interdependent relationship between water, energy and food systems, while carefully managing and balancing the world's resources to support a sustainable food system.

The 7 m x 7 m playing field is raised approximately 70 cm above the ground and is bordered by a system of kerbs at least 20 cm high. It is covered with a low-pile carpet similar to those found in many public or commercial buildings. Any low-pile carpet can be used for training, and will react in the same way to play pieces and robots.

<ul>
<li>
NEXUS GOALS : boxes of varying height that are open at the top for CONSERVING WATER and ENERGY. A nexus is a connection where several elements meet. The bottom section has a rotating mechanism that realises PRODUCED FOOD. 12 NEXUS GOALS are located near the center of the PLAYING FIELD, and 12 are located below the FOOD WAREHOUSE.

BALANCE : to be considered BALANCED, robots must be fully supported (directly or indirectly) by the RAMP or the PLATFORM with no component touching the PLAYING FIELD surface and no obstruction influencing the RAMP position.
</li>

<li>
BALANCE MULTIPLIER : a multiplier based on the total number of robots BALANCED on the RAMP or the PLATFORM and is applied to a REGIONAL ALLIANCE’s WATER plus ENERGY plus FOOD produced points earned.
</li>

<li>
COOPERTITION BONUS : additional points awarded to a GLOBAL ALLIANCE if five or more robots are BALANCED at the end of the match.

<figcaption>WATER, ENERGY, and FOOD</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<ul>
<li>
WATER : Blue playground balls made of a rubber material with an inflated diameter of 275 mm (± 5 mm). WATER are CONSERVED in the NEXUS GOALS and RESERVOIR.
</li>

<li>
ENERGY : Green playground balls made of a rubber material with an inflated diameter of 275 mm (± 5 mm). ENERGY are CONSERVED in the NEXUS GOALS and RESERVOIR.
</li>

<li>
FOOD : orange playground balls made of a rubber material with an inflated diameter of 275 mm (± 5 mm). FOOD are SECURED in the FOOD WAREHOUSE.
</li>

<li>
PRODUCE : The result of successfully CONSERVING one WATER and one ENERGY in a NEXUS GOAL, whereby a FOOD is released into play.
</li>

<li>
CONSERVE : the process of robots placing or launching WATER and ENERGY into the NEXUS GOALS and RESERVOIR.
</li>

<li>
SECURE : the process of robots or human players placing FOOD in the FOOD WAREHOUSE.
</li>

</ul>

### Rules affecting robot design (see manual for others) :

<ul>

<li>
Robots and human players may hold an unlimited number of WATER, ENERGY, and FOOD at any time during the match. 
</li>

<li>
Robots must start the MATCH within a 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm volume. Before the match can start, all robots on the PLAYING FIELD must meet this requirement. The national flags and REGIONAL ALLIANCE colors are allowed to exceed this volume constraint.
</li>

<li>
The color of the regional alliance (red or blue) is displayed before each match by LEDs connected to the +5V Power port on the Control Hub.
</li>

<li>
Robots must not be designed to attach to any part of the PLAYING FIELD.
</li>

<li>
Robots must not have sharp edges that could cut someone or damage the PLAYING FIELD, WATER, ENERGY or FOOD.
</li>

<li>
Teams are responsible for building a robust robot that won't tip over easily or get tangled up by minor contact.
</li>

<li>
The PLAYING FIELD and placement of components making up the PLAYING FIELD may vary by up to ± 25 mm except if specifically noted in the 2024 FGC Playing Field Drawings. Robot designs should be robust enough to work even if the PLAYING FIELD, WATER, ENERGY, or FOOD are not perfectly sized or inflated or have a slightly different texture.
</li>

<li>
ROBOTS must be designed to permit easy removal of WATER, ENERGY, and FOOD without requiring the ROBOT to be powered. For example, the ROBOT should not require power to run a mechanism, actuate a servo, or reverse an intake to release a game piece.
</li>

<li>
ROBOTS must be constructed from only the quantity and type of components included in the 2024 FIRST Global REV Robotics Kit of Parts unless otherwise explicitly allowed. Each team will receive one 2024 FIRST Global REV Robotics Kit of Parts composed of two totes: one tote containing a FTC Starter Kit and one tote containing FIRST Global-Specific Components. 
</li>

<li>
The official list of allowable components is identified in the combined 2024 FGC Bill of Materials (link coming soon), with the following exceptions :
	<ul>
	<li>
	Tools (5.5 mm nut driver, 5.5 mm combination wrenches, #25 chain tool, and allen wrenches)
	</li>
	<li>
	Control System (battery charger and REV USB PS4 Compatible Gamepad)
	</li>
	<li>
	FTC Starter Kit Guide and Bill of Materials
	</li>
	<li>
	2024 FIRST Global Challenge game pieces (WATER, ENERGY, and FOOD)
	</li>
	<li>
	Bicycle pump
	</li>
	<li>
	Plastic storage totes
	</li>
	<li>
	Cardboard shipping boxes
	</li>
	<li>
	Plastic and foam packaging materialse
	</li>
	</ul> 
</li>

<li>
ROBOTS may also be constructed using the following additional “non-REV Robotics” parts:
 	<ul>
	<li>
	Any commercially available M3 screws (up to 50 mm long) and any commercially available nuts and/or washers that are the same sizes as those included in the 2024 FIRST Global REV Robotics Kit of Parts. These additional parts are to be used as replacements and may not be used to increase the quantity included on the final ROBOT.
	</li>
	<li>
	Additional zip ties or cable ties. Must be functionally equivalent to REV Robotics zip ties in all ways (for example, may not be longer, stronger, or stiffer).
	</li>
	<li>
	Lubricants used only in small amounts to reduce friction within the ROBOT. Lubricants must not contaminate the PLAYING FIELD, WATER, ENERGY, FOOD, or other ROBOTS. Use of lubricants is limited to :
		<ul>
		<li>
		Non-aerosol grease used in extreme moderation only on the internal gearing of motors or servos as needed after a gearing repair.
		</li>
		<li>
		Bicycle chain lubricant for repairing rusty roller chain, provided it is used sparingly and excess amounts are wiped off.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	Small amounts of tape or heat-shrink tubing used solely for :
		<ul><li>
		Labeling wires, motors, or sensors.
		</li>
		<li>
		Securing wire connections.
		</li>
		<li>
		Note that tape, glue, or other adhesives are not allowed for purposes other than those listed above/not allowed for assembling the robot.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Robots may use only one control system. This means one Control Hub, one Expansion Hub, and one 12-Volt battery.
</li>

<li>
There is no minimum or maximum weight restriction on the ROBOT.
</li>

<li>
ROBOTS may include personalization and decoration provided it does not affect or enhance the performance of the ROBOT. For example, sponsor logos, flags, and artwork. Paint is allowed provided that it does not change the properties of the material it is being applied to (such as changing the coefficient of friction).
</li>
</ul>
<br>


### Software :

<ul>
<li>
ROBOT software must meet the minimum version requirements. The correct versions are as follows :
</li>
<li>
The Control Hub OS must be updated to version 1.1.4 and the Robot Controller application must be updated to version 9.1.
</li>
<li>
The Driver Hub OS must be updated to version 1.2.0 and the Driver Station application must be updated to version 9.1.
</li>
</ul>
