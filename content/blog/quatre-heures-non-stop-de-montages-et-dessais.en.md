Then we tried our ideas. 

Three groups were formed : Quentin and Mathis for a try on a ball catcher system, Antoine and Franck for another one and François on his onw for a new frame.

 Finaly, Mathis had a brilliant idea that we decided to choose.

After hours of building, everyone is tired except François who is still finishing the bottom af the frame accordingly to our project.
