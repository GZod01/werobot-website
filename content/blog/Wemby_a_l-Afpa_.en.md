## Une date importante
Wednesday, September 4, 2024 was a very special date for our team, as we went to the Afpa in Évreux (27) to finally present our robot to our sponsors !

Afpa (Association for Adult Vocational Training) is an organization that offers training in a variety of fields, including industry, construction and the service sector, to help you imagine and build a professional project.

**The playground**

Once we arrived at the venue, we immediately took the necessary steps to recreate the competition playing field as faithfully as possible.

With this in mind, Afpa trainees created a module similar to the one that will be present on the playing field in Athens, enabling the balls to be recovered, thus guaranteeing us training under real competition conditions! What's more, the development of this module was obviously beneficial to the trainees, as it required a great deal of teamwork !

**The unveiling of our robot and the discovery of our medal**

This event also marked the first public appearance of our robot, so it was high time to introduce it to our fans !

So it was with great enthusiasm that we unveiled our robot to the public, named Wemby, in reference to French basketball icon Victor Wembanyama, since our robot can also be very tall !

By the way, we won't tell you any more about Wemby, as we performed a simulated match directly in front of our audience after viewing the game rules !

We were also able to see for the first time a copy of the 3d-printed medals we'll be distributing to young people around the world in Athens! This production of medals in very large quantities (1000!) was made possible thanks to NAE (Normandie AeroEspace), whom we would like to thank warmly for their support and hard work !

 **Our supporters** 

Our audience was very varied: of course, we were joined by representatives of our corporate sponsors such as SKF, NAE and Credit Agricole Normandie-Seine. The Gaillon establishments that have also lent us their support were also present: the Le Temps Pour Soi beauty salon and the La Marina restaurant! The municipality of Gaillon, the birthplace of our association, was also on hand, represented by the mayor and her deputy! Last but not least, we'd like to thank Vernon's BPM radio station once again for its media coverage of our team and our projects !

Last but not least, we would like to thank Afpa for lending us their premises, as well as their employees and trainees who were able to attend our demonstration, and the parents who were present, not forgetting Nadège, our super communication mentor, without whom all this would have been very difficult to set up !

We then had the pleasure of carrying out a ***FIRST* Global Challenge** social networking challenge with our audience, which consisted of posting photos/videos of our supporters cheering us on; the perfect opportunity with some great photos and videos to round off this great afternoon !

Last but not least, Afpa gave each of the youngsters a tote bag with little gifts that will come in very handy in Athens during the competition !
