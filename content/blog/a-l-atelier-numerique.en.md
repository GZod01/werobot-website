##  In the beginning there was…introduction to the Python language !
Timothé & Quentin have accepted to rise to a few challenging games from a dedicated site 
well-known among the potential contestants for the world I.T olympics.

 Www.france-ioi.org

## Nathanaël, Alexandre & Constantin are so engrossed they don’t even notice my spying over their shoulders.They are focused on using a Block language on already built-up robot to learn 
3D-modelling.

## As for Zeineb and Vivian, they are racking their brains on Block programming.

Block programming is a visual language using blocks like puzzle pieces interlocking so as to write out a programme.

Vivian is aiming at joining the WeRobot Contest Team as quickly as possible so he is EXTREMELY motivated. He is most likely to join soon !
