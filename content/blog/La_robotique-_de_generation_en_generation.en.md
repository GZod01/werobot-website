After making the children's eyes shine at the [screening of our film about our competition in Athens at the Vernon cinema](https://werobot.fr/blog/l-aventure_we_robot_a_athenes_sur_grand_ecran_-/), it was the seniors' turn to discover our adventure!

For almost a year now, our association has been based in the premises of the independent residence in Gaillon, which is mainly inhabited by retired people.

  

We often have the pleasure of running into residents who come to see us work on our premises and to whom we regularly show our progress on our projects.

  
## The screening
  

We therefore decided to organize a screening of our film on November 16 in the building for the residents, so that they could finally discover our projects and understand the excitement that was being felt more and more in the residence as our participation in the ***FIRST* Global Challenge** 2024 approached !

We decided to accompany the screening of our film with a little snack to make the moment more convivial between generations! Tricolor cake, drinks and other delicacies bearing the image of France, and of course our film, not forgetting Wemby, all came together to make for a great time, which parents of young members of the association were also able to attend and take part in !

Indeed, it seemed very important to us to present our robot to the residents, since we had worked for months on its design, which proved very successful during the competition !

As well as being presented, residents also tried their hand at driving our robot  ;)
