For the first time in our small non-profit history, one of our teams will attend to the <a href="https://www.coupederobotique.fr">coupe de France de robotique </a>.

Matthieu and Mohamed are going to meet the best french teams (most of them made of students in engineering schools or even young engineers). In this contest, robots are **autonomous**.

We Robot will most likey be the younget team of the competition.

It will take place in la Roche-sur-Yon from October 29th to October 31st. If you wish, you can watch all the matches (from qualification to finals) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PlaneteSciences"> the Planète Sciences YouTube channel</a>. 

Our official poster which describes our robot can be seen <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tr04vjwywx08pdz/We_Robot_Eurobot2020_Poster_v2.4_PS.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.

Meanwhile the two guys work hard because there's only one week left !
