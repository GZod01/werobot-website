On February 8, 2025, it was an emotionally rich day for our middle school students from the digital workshop! Indeed, this day marked their very first participation in a robotics competition, the LYRC 2025 (Luxembourg Youth Robotics Challenge)!

To learn more about the competition itself and the preparation of our teams, you can check out our article on the subject :)

Our two teams, one consisting of 8th graders and the other of 9th graders, each have a dedicated space for making modifications and improvements to their robots' programs. The students are also supported by Matthieu and Mohamed, two alumni of the association who share their valuable advice :)

After making the final tweaks to the programming, it's time for our young competitors to get down to business: the first matches are about to begin !

In terms of the competition structure, there are two qualification matches before advancing to the playoffs.

Let's go !

For both teams, the first two matches are marked by strong scores, but unfortunately, they are narrowly outscored by the opposing teams by a few points: the 8th graders score 31 points against 33, and the 9th graders score 30 points against 31. The results are very tight, so the competitors don’t give up for the next rounds !

But before that, a little break is in order between the matches ;) Everyone gathers at a stand offering an activity to build a small robot that moves by vibrations, an activity that thrilled everyone !

After this fun break, the teams get ready to play their last qualification match. The 8th graders are the first to resume, and their prior programming work pays off quite well: they win their first match by 1 point against the opposing team, congratulations to them !

Next, it's the 9th graders' turn to play their second match. Unfortunately, a programming issue causes the robot to exit the playing area, which results in no points for the team.

When the results of each team’s qualification for the playoffs are announced, unfortunately, neither of our teams qualifies for the next round due to a lack of points.

Even though the teams didn’t make it as far as they had hoped, we want to congratulate them for this very first competition. A lot of time and effort went into this challenge, and it is undoubtedly the first of many to come! We are convinced that all the efforts put in will pay off one day ! This first competition was an opportunity to experience the competitive atmosphere, learn how to manage a project in special conditions, and most importantly, collect great memories !

A huge congratulations for this first competition !
