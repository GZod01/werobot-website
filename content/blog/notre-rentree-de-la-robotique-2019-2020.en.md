This Sunday September 29th, in our venue at the Douaires, we started the robotic year of 2019-2020 by organizing a meeting with our team, the first time since the release of the Beta rules of eurobot 2020.

Like each end of september month, we were impatient to discover the new rules of the eurobot challenge for this year. The ideas began to pop up in the minds of our team and we were longing to meet. This meeting, is part of a first phase of thoughts where we will study the differents possibilites and approchs that we can use for this challenge.

So, this sunday we were able to think about the roles of our robots "Which action our robots will do ?" the answer to this question is crucial to allow us to define a goal notably for the autonomus robot which [base was created this summer](https://werobot.fr/blog/summer-fun). So this was a good afternoon of brainstorming on the challenge.

This blog article is also the occasion to talk of some change we made on our venue.

Two weeks ago we introduced new furnitures in our rooms: somes shelfs where we can put the hardware as well as shelfs for our workshop. We also added a small sofa in order that our mentors can rest while we are working on the robot (ok i'm little bit exagagereting here but it's close to the reality right?).

Of course, we will continue to improve our venue this year. 

This year look very interesting and full of bouncing for our team. 
On this point: we are happy to present to you the team:
