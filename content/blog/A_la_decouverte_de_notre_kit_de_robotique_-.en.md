Today, we invite you to discover the contents of the robotics kit for the ***FIRST* Global Challenge**, the international junior robotics competition taking place from September 26 to 29, 2024 in Athens !

  

This kit is a central element of the competition, since it's exclusively with its contents that we can build our robot !

So it was with great anticipation and curiosity that we unpacked it :)  And it's also with great pleasure that we discover new elements in this kit compared to that of the 2023 edition ! To find out all about it with us, simply watch our video dedicated to the unboxing of the kit :
