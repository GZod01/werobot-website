## Meeting and Sharing with Young Gaillon Judokas – Laurent and Team France We Robot

To complete the 4th "Social Media Challenge" of FGC Panama 2025, the We Robot Team met with Laurent Gringoire's judokas, who kindly welcomed us for his last class of the year to share our values and introduce competitive robotics to the children.

We observed:

 - shared values  
 - many members of Team France previously trained at this judo club, which is probably not a coincidence.

A wonderful meeting — and perhaps future judokas joining the robotics club in the years to come to carry on the legacy.
