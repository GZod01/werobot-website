## An incredible evening !
M Didier Herbeaux, président of the <a href="https://www.girv.com">GIRV</a> and director of <a href="https://www.ariane.group/fr">ArianeGroup</a> in Vernon, invited us to introduce our non-profit in front of all the members of its group on December the 13th. It is the opportunity to be noticed and able to fundraise.

For this event, our team is well prepared :

1. Each student has written a text ;
2. We met twice : both for training their oral skills and setup the slideshow;
3. Antoine built it.

Usually, this general assembly is dedicated to politician, and this evening it was also the case. We attend to speeches from several politicians from local ones (the mayor of Vernon : François Ouzilleau) to national one ( the Minister in charge of Territorial Communities : Sébastien Lecornu). And of course, these politicians attend to our presentation along with a small hundred of representatives of the private sector in the Vernon area.

After their showing, they were applaused and moreover, Jérôme Taconnet, the general manager of the "Campus de l''Espace" in Vernon, proposed to lend us a room on the Campus for all our activities. And Vincent Megret, director of <a href="http://www.skf.com/fr/our-company/skf-en-france/vernon/index.html">SKF Vernon</a>, proposed to buy us the 3D printer we dream of.

We spent the end of the evening on cloud nine, chatting with people impressed by what we've already done, by the presentation of the students and interested by our goals.

Next step : a visit to the "Campus de l'Espace" and a meeting with some engineers working there. We hope to setup a technical partnership to help us with the design of our robots.
