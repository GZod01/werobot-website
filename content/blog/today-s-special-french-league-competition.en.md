## The goal is to appeal to the teens’curiosity for I.T.The competition is meant to pave the way for a larger insight in I.T.It shows how much fun, ludicruous and creative IT can be,ranging from logic games and information imagery to algorithmic thinking.
Having fun does not mean less concentration and Franck makes gently sure that Vivian ,Timothé, Quentin, Zeineb,Constantin, Alexandre, Nathanaël and  Houda stay quiet and focused on their rounds of games.
