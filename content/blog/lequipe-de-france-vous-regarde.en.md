The website that hosts our blog gives us the ability to install some utilities.
One of them is a statistic utility we can use to know the number of visits to the site, even on each blog post.
But the feature we like best is to watch (not in real time but nearly) the location of our visitors.

Thanks to the First Global Challenge we have a blog followed by people all over the world
