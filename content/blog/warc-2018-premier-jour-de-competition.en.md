During the first day, we discovered the venue, we attended to a meeting to explain the rules, we practiced a bit with the robot but mostly we met again some "old" pals from Washington (particularly Sue, Ilylia and Diane). We also were invited to a "friendship night" which ended under an incredible downpour.

Today is the first day of competition.

Here's a small reminder of the rules for this competition  :
During each match, two alliances of three teams are opposed. The three teams  of an alliance cooperate to earn points. Every team in an alliance scores all the points earnt by the alliance. Of course, the alliance with the biggest score wins the match.
Moreover, the competition is in two phases :
A chaque match voit s'opposer deux alliances constituées de trois équipes. Les trois équipes d'une même alliances coopèrent pendant le match afin de récolter le maximum de points. Les points récoltés par une alliance sont attribués à chaque équipe de l'alliance. L'alliance ayant le plus de point remporte le match.
De plus, la compétition est divisée en deux phases :
1 - The qualifying phase, during which alliances are randomly selected for every match and the scores for a team add up match after match. At the end of this phase, the top 4 teams are qualified for the final phae and become "Alliance captain".
2 - The final phase. At the beginning, the four captains choose two teams each to form their alliance. Those alliance will last during all the phase. Then there is a semi-final and a final to choose the Championship Winning Alliance.

For once, the first match goes well. We only have one small technical problem but our alliance won 93 vs 77 and our team scores about 25 points.

Second match : we lose 46 vs 55. At this moment we rank 9th (out of 30)
Third match : we win 69 vs 33. The score is low but we're very happy with our robot.
Fourth match : we win again 57 vs 54 but this is once again a very low score because ao a bad alliance strategy. We rank 12th at the end of this 4 matchs.
We have one match left today but most of the teams only have 4 today.
We lose this last match 69 vs 87.

The overall feeling at the end of the day is disappointment. Our robot works really good, Mathis and Antoine cooperate well. But think we're not lucky with our alliances.

Nevertheless, we set up an evening in the center of Guiyang with other team to have fun together and this was awesome !
