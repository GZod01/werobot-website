The association has resumed its collaboration with the social center Condorcet at the comunity center "les jardins de bas".

This Friday, we welcomed 5 new young people to discover the mbot and its possibilities.
This first session was dedicated to the assembly of the robot. It's a manual session that's particularly popular with kids because they can build their own robot independently following the handbook provided which is particularly rich in explicit details and scketches.

This year, we decided to allow 4 young volunteers, who participated in the workshop the previous year, to come and help the new ones. We hope to develop knowledge-sharing and mutual aid.
