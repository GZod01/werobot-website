We Robot is moving! We're leaving Les Douaires and settling on the ground floor of the CCAS Gaillon's senior residence to enhance our association's living environment.

Don't worry, We Robot isn't that old yet, no need for a nursing home; a senior residence is just fine for us!

Indeed, We Robot association moved on November 25, 2023, to the Flamants-Cygnes senior residence.

We want to thank all the volunteers (parents and children alike) who mobilized to complete the move in just one morning! It was a friendly and enjoyable moment to share together.

We now have two rooms in each of the two buildings of the residence.

In the Flamants building, we set up the robotics workshop with the large gaming table for robotics competitions.

In the Cygnes building, we've set up a room with about ten computer stations to run the Saturday morning digital workshop.

This new location brings more benefits than drawbacks.

The main one being that we are now closer to the city center of Gaillon, making it easier for all our members from the Gaillon-Aubevoye area to commute.

Additionally, our presence on the ground floor avoids the need for climbing stairs, making our premises more accessible.

Finally, the premises provided by the Gaillon municipality are in much better sanitary and functional condition than those at Les Douaires.

We also thank the Gaillon municipality for their assistance with the new premises (especially the electrical work).

On Saturday, December 2nd, the digital workshop inaugurated the new premises, and the children were delighted!

You can find us on Saturday mornings for the digital workshop and Sunday afternoons for the robotics workshop.
