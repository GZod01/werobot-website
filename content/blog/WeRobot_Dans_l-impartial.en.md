## On June 3, 2024, our team welcomed Pierre Boissonnat, journalist at *L'Impartial*, a local newspaper based in Les Andelys (27).


During the meeting, we naturally spoke of our eagerness to take part in the Junior Robotics Olympics, before also raising the subject of funding, which is vital to our success in the competition.

We also had the opportunity to show our robot in action to Pierre, who even got to drive it !

We're delighted to see this newspaper supporting our projects, as this isn't the first time *L'Impartial* has documented our participation in the First Global Challenge ; you'll find [here](https://actu.fr/normandie/gaillon_27275/eure-ces-cinq-lyceens-racontent-leur-aventure-aux-jeux-olympiques-de-la-robotique-a-singapour_60292412.html) an article about We Robot's participation in the 2023 edition of the competition in Singapore.

So we'd like to thank Pierre Boissonnat and *L'Impartial* for granting us an article in the July 26, 2024 newspaper and getting the word out about our team !
