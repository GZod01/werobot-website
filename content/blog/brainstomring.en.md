Today we had an intensive brainstorming to plan our nexts actions :

1) Video : we decided to record them in english but with prepared questions. Each team member has to prepare the story he'd like to tell and we'll then invent questions according to it. We shall shoot the interviews next week end.

2) About our logo : The twitter account is set but our logos aren't that nice. Hopefully François and Antoine know an infographist  (Hi Stéphanie :-D ) that will help us creating a nice logo and improving our banner. 

3) Finaly, the robot : many, many ideas poped out during this brainstorming. We made lots of drawing to explain them to others. Some were rejected, some were improved
