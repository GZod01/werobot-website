The ***FIRST*** **Global Challenge** 2024 edition takes place from September 26 to 29 at the Stade de la Paix et de l'Amiti√©, a symbolic venue that perfectly represents the values promoted by the competition organization !

By the time the team arrives, a festive atmosphere can already be felt among all the other teams from all over the world, as demonstrated by our musical encounter with the Venezuelan team !

We then discover our stand, which we hasten to decorate to best represent the colors of France :

We then set off to meet all the other teams already in the stadium. We met almost all the teams on this first day, the perfect opportunity to get to know each other, and there's nothing better than exchanging gifts! So it was with great pleasure that we presented all team members with our superb medals, 3d printed by NAE (Normandie AeroEspace) and FAN (Fabrication Additive en Normandie) !

Next, our Wemby robot is inspected by the <i>FIRST</i> Global team to check that it complies with the rules imposed on robots.
It goes without saying that the French robot passed certification without a hitch !

After lunch, it was Wemby's turn to play! Our team headed off to the robot training area, where we could test the game in real-life conditions, and perfect our robot if necessary !

During its first test match, Wemby encountered a mechanical problem, which was fortunately quickly repaired by our super-team of roboticists !

After this very emotional first day, we headed for the beach at the port of Piraeus, just a few dozen metres from the stadium, with some great photos !

Our day ends with a mythical Athens landmark, the Acropolis! From this hill, a breathtaking view of Athens by night is visible !
