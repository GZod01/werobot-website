As part of our participation in the ***FIRST* Global Challenge** 2024 in Athens, our team had to complete a number of “social networking challenges”, including getting robotics recognized as a sport. To do this, one of the challenges was to get in touch with influential public figures or contact our government, which we did !

Aurélien, a programmer with our association, sent an e-mail to the Elysée to explain our project :

And we were delighted to receive a reply from Rodrigue Furcy, Chief of Staff at the Elysée Palace :

Then, during the competition, we met some very nice people, including Kyriákos Mitsotákis, the Greek Prime Minister, with whom Louise and Léane were able to talk!

Finally, after our return to France following our fine performance in Athens, we were very surprised to learn that Joe Biden, President of the United States, where the competition was born, had sent a letter to all the participating teams to congratulate us on our commitment !
