## It is all hands on deck to lay the table : Everyone is ready to lay down the mat, whose plans have been provided by Eurobot. However , the measures have been worked on by We Robot to fit in  the wooden table, a double grid pattern has been added to ease the driving of the robot. Last but not least, the WeRobot logo has been printed right in the middle .Here it is : all included !
WeRobot’s  historical printing company has manufactured it.  Everybody’s calm and smoothness is required to paste the mat onto the table.And Here it is ! All fresh and new !

##Pauline ‘s help is welcomed : sorting all the stuff away from the table, put things away and assembling the layers into cherry cakes.
