## We would like to thank all our sponsors !

Following our visit on 15 May 2024 to the [SKF Mechatronics](https://www.skf.com/fr) site in Saint-Marcel (27), which you can find on this [article](https://werobot.fr/en/blog/2024/we-robot-at-skf/), we are delighted to announce that SKF Group has become the first official sponsor of We Robot! We are delighted with this partnership, especially as SKF had already supported us in 2019 by helping to buy our 3D printer.

These generous supporters are playing a full part in the development and success of We Robot's future projects, such as the <i>FIRST</i> Global Challenge which will take place from 26 to 29 September 2024 in Athens; a competition during which we will be responsible for promoting our sponsors internationally !
What's more, we're always coming across companies like Schneider Electric and Crédit Agricole that are ready to support us.
