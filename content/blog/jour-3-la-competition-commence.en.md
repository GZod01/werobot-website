The challenge begins today with the first three rounds.
All the DAR seems to be on fire.
It is crowdly and buzzing eveywhere. Students, robots, journalists, officials and some spectators are walking and running.

For our team the first math was awful : our robot is a bit weak and was bumped into while in the river. Some parts broke and then our alliance was prevented from hanging by our oponents.
Very sad score at the end of the round.

But the team fixed the robot, improved it a bit and then it went better.

Moreover, they were interviewed :

They were thanked by an official diplomat of Gambia for the help they gave to the team of this country.

Indeed Mathis and Quentin helped them building an arm to hang their robot and Antoine quickly wrote a code in java to allow them to pilot their robot.

The students also went to support and watch other teams competing.
