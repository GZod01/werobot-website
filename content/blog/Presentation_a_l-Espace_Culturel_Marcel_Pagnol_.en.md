On Wednesday December 11, 2024, our team gathered at the Marcel Pagnol cultural center in Val-d'Hazey for a presentation of our adventures in Athens and, more generally, of the We Robot association.

Arriving at around 2pm in the auditorium, our team prepares to welcome all the guests: setting up the equipment needed for our presentation and the screening of the film retracing our adventure in Athens, welcoming and chatting with the public, not forgetting setting up the refreshment bar and snack bar for the end of the event.

Our audience is arriving little by little, and we're delighted to see that its composition is very varied: from pensioners from the independent residence where we robot's premises are located, to parents of association members, sponsors, members of the municipality and curious youngsters, all generations and profiles come together to spend a pleasant afternoon.

Our presentation begins at around 3 p.m., during which we introduce (or rediscover :) our association, its history and its participation in various competitions. We focus in particular on the First Global Challenge competition, in which our association has already taken part three times, and which is also our most recent competition for the team, allowing us to set the scene for the screening of Louise's film !

The latter is then broadcast, and it seems to have really won over the audience, with laughter and applause.

We then move on to a phase of the presentation reserved for questions from the audience, which we are delighted to answer.

This question-and-answer session is followed by a demonstration of Wemby's skills, as popular as ever with the public ! The most curious even come to see it up close, and some even pilot it :)





Then it's time for a snack, during which exchanges between members of the public and members of the association continue, not only to make us better known, but also perhaps to awaken vocations in the younger members of the audience !

Our warmest thanks go to the municipality of Val-d'Hazey for allowing us to stage a presentation at the Espace Culturel Marcel Pagnol, and to the staff who helped us set up the equipment. And, of course, we'd like to thank all those who attended our presentation, who provided us with essential support !
