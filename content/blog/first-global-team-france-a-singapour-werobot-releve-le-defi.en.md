For WeRobot, this is the second opportunity to participate in this event, the first being in 2017 in Washington. Elina, Luna, Timothé, Quentin, and Aurélien, five students from André Malraux High School in Gaillon, will represent France. This is an exceptional opportunity to enrich themselves through this challenge and trip to Southeast Asia. François and Franck, our two coaches, will once again supervise this fabulous adventure! Our team is united and motivated to do our best to achieve our goals and, above all, to have fun !

Antoine, a former club member who participated in the Washington competition, couldn't resist and came to share his experience.
