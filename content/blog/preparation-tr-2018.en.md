The bee is a 100% mechanical robot, its goal is to be triggered by one of the team's robots and to slide along a sloap so as to burst a balloon representing a flower.

4th challenge : An autonomous robot.
It is an optional challenge but this robot can help the main one. We only ask it to trigger the bee but this is a very important mission becaise the bee woths a lot of points.
