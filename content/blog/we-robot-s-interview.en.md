On June 10, 2024, 3 members of our team had the chance to be interviewed and appear on the radio! Louise, Timothé and Franck went to Vernon to the bpm radio premises where the interview took place.

Our appearance is part of the “Association of the Week” section of the radio, which therefore allowed us to raise awareness of We Robot and its future projects, like the First Global Challenge 2024 which will take place in Athens.

This interview was an opportunity to learn a little more about the association, its history or to explain in more detail what the competitions in which we were able to participate consisted of.

But we won't tell you any more, because you can listen to our interview by clicking on the following link by going to the date of June 15, 2024!
