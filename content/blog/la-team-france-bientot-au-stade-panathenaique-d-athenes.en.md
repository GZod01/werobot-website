## The opening ceremony of the <i>FIRST</i> Global Challenge Junior Olympic Games will take place at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.

The construction of the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens was inaugurated in the summer of 330 BC, on the occasion of the great Panatheneas. It was completely rebuilt in marble around 140 AD and could accommodate 50 000 people. The stadium was abandoned at the end of the 4th century and fell into ruin. A wheat field covered the site and the marble covering disappeared, reused for other constructions.
The stadium was rebuilt for the first Olympic Games of the modern era in 1896. Rebuilt in marble, it stands out for its high degree of fidelity to the ancient monument.

As an Olympic venue with a rich history of international cooperation and achievement, <i>FIRST</i> Global will be hosting the Athens 2024 Challenge Opening Ceremony there. This will be an exceptional moment for the 190 teams, the hundreds of volunteers and all the spectators. Robotics competition is a real sport, and we'll be doing the Panathenaic Stadium proud.
