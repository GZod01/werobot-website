Friday October 18 was a big first for our team! It was the first time we'd been invited to the cinema to present our association and our projects !

A few weeks before our departure to Athens for the FIRST Global Challenge international robotics competition, the Vernon cinema contacted us, explaining that the release of the film Le Robot Sauvage would be the perfect opportunity for We Robot to visit the cinema and be discovered by the audience in the theatre before the film was shown !

Of course, we accept this offer with great enthusiasm, and during the competition we don't forget to film some passages to use them to create a presentation video, which will be projected on the big screen!

## D-Day

We're warmly welcomed by the Vernon cinema team, with whom we hasten to set up everything in preparation for our presentation: Wemby is placed on stage with the balloons, while the batteries are recharged for a Wemby demonstration.

The audience, made up of children accompanied by their parents, began to settle into the hall at around 8.30 pm. 


A few minutes later, it's our turn to take the stage and make ourselves known, before broadcasting our video on the big screen !

Louise, who is in charge of the audiovisual side of our team, made this superb little film about our stay in Athens during the FIRST Global Challenge 2024 competition ! 
Well done !

Don't worry if you weren't at the cinema with us on October 18, you too can watch our film here :

<br><br>

After the applause following the showing of our film, it's time for the children's questions, which we answer in a way that's most understandable for the very young.

After the questions, it was Wemby's turn to shine once again, this time in the eyes of the children! The little spectators have moved closer to the stage to see our robot, who always seems to be such a hit! 
Wemby moves, Pierrick places the 4 balls on it, the elevator system starts up - the kids love it ! 
The team also answers any questions from the curious little ones, not forgetting to show off our beautiful gold medals, before bringing our presentation to a close.

We'd like to extend our warmest thanks to the Vernon cinema for its warm welcome and the time it took to organize our visit, as well as to Frédérique Perette, the cinema's communications officer, who didn't hesitate to film us and post us on the cinema's Instagram account! She also helped us organize the evening. Thank you so much !
