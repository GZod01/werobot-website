At last this 14th of July has arrived !

After getting up at 5 am (GMT+1) we reached the airport at 7 am.

Our flight, originaly from Paris to Dublin then to Washington was changed for a direct one !

We hopefully had a "lunch"

And then we landed around 3.30 pm (GMT-5).
We are in the USA !! This is the first time for all the team members

After having waited for our luggages we finally met the first global staff and some of the other teams

We were very tired.
