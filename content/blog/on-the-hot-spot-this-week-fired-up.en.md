## The Geeks , father & son

Damien admits it easily: He is a kind of a geek.As a senior engineer, he enjoys taking part in the searching and testing of new set-upsand  component assemblings.He is curious about what the younger ones are willing to do and is ready to give a hand.

On the sofa, Aurélien , his son,is sweating blood and tears to completely change the set-up of his PC. He has opted for Linux, hoping to be freer and quicker in his programming.
