On March 22, 2025, We Robot participated in the national qualifiers of the First Tech Challenge (FTC) in Lyon, [following our previous victory in Levallois-Perret !](https://werobot.fr/blog/we_robot_au_ftc_2024/)
## Arrival

As soon as we arrived, the team started organizing to be as efficient as possible throughout the day and to stay highly motivated! (Franck proudly wears the glitter from our robot :)

Before diving into the competition, we took the opportunity to retest our robot on the actual game field and made any last-minute adjustments to our robot.

Finally, we went through the robot inspection process before continuing our FTC adventure !

## Qualification Matches
Around 11 a.m., the competition officially began, and we played our first qualification matches, which would allow us to move on to the playoffs if we earned enough points. Unfortunately, our robot quickly encountered technical issues, and our alliances were not favorable, leading to the defeat of our first two qualification matches.

<br><br>

However, we didn’t give up and bet everything on our third match, which we won with a great number of points! We continued on this positive momentum and won our last two matches! Our last victories and scores opened the door to the famous playoffs, the final phase of the competition !

This phase of the competition also gave us the opportunity to form an alliance with the team of our choice. Without hesitation, we teamed up with Ferdibot, a team with whom we had already shared our victory in Levallois-Perret in February !

## Playoffs
The Ferdibot/We Robot alliance played its first playoff match, which didn’t go as planned due to technical problems, and our grabber detached… We then entered the tiebreaker match and could not afford to make any more mistakes if we wanted to continue our FTC adventure.

<br><br>

However, our alliance made a strong comeback in the first tiebreaker match, achieving a great score of 115 points against 90 for the opposing team ! In our third match, we once again scored well, but unfortunately, it was not enough to match the opposing team’s score.

Thus, our FTC adventure came to an end after this match, but we are very proud of the journey we’ve had and our amazing comeback, which led We Robot to finish 11th out of 44 teams.

We would like to thank our supporters for standing by us throughout this incredible adventure (and this will surely not be the last one!); and we would also like to warmly thank Ferdibot, with whom we had another great competition and created beautiful memories. Above all, we congratulate them on winning the Inspiration Award, which grants them a ticket to the World Finals in Houston, USA. We Robot sends all its support to the high school students from Lycée Ferdinand Buisson in Elbeuf and wishes them a fantastic competition in Texas, hoping they bring back even more awards !
