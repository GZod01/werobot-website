This morning, the fifth series end up and we still rank 12th.
There is only one match left in the qualifying phase.
We won't be in the top 4.
But, the alliance captains will still be able to choose us for the final phase. So we have to be brilliant for them to notice us.

Just before the last match, the students answer their first interview in China.

We win the last match 110 vs 29. This make us climb really high in the final ranking :

We are fifth ! This is incredible.

Moreover, the first team had a deal with the third to form an alliance together. Because of it, we become alliance captains too !

So we have to choose two teams to form our alliance for these final phases.
Many non-qualified teams come to woo us ! We study their robots, their weekness and strength. We hesitate. And then make a choice !

At this moment, we're not really sure to have made the right choice.
And unfortunately, the firt match of the semi-finale proves us wrong :(.
Indeed, one of the robots of our alliance don't manage to hang which make us lose the match.
So we decide to modify our strategy and then, everything goes fast. Nothing can stop us anymore.
We win the next two matchs and we're qualified for the final.
We win the final ( 2 matchs vs 0).

WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS
