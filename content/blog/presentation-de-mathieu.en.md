We talked about Mathieu in our last post but i never introduced him.

Mathieu is not an official member of our team but he sure is an important part of it.
Actually Mathieu is our cameraman ! He tries to be with us most of the time to take pictures and to film ou session. He also brought all the necessary hardware to lead the interviews.

He is a very good friend of Quentin and we didn't choose him by chance but because we know his skills. Indeed, he's fond of videos and manage a very high quality youtube channel.
