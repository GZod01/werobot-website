<p>The TEAM FRANCE shares the goals advocated by Dean Kamen and his foundation <i>FIRST</i> since 1989 :</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a community dedicated to the cooperative pursuit of a more peaceful world, achieved by innovating together to ensure the life, freedom, success, advancement, and happiness of all who share our planet.</li>
<li>We believe that every person has special gifts that make them innovators. The problems of planet Earth cannot be solved by an individual or a single nation alone. When we work together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish, and we can share the benefits of our new inventions with the entire world.</li>
</ul>

<p>TEAM FRANCE aligns with the principles highlighted by the FIRST foundation :</p>
<ul>
<li>We promote peace by working together on science and technology projects. These undertakings foster common understanding and experiences.</li>
<li>We treat everyone with unqualified kindness and respect. Empathy and hard work are the backbone of progress.</li>
<li>We recognize the contributions of others. We learn more from each other than we do alone.</li>
<li>We believe that the world does not need losers to have winners. One person’s success does not inevitably lead to another’s loss; instead, shared innovations can bring both rewards to innovators and a greater quality of life for all.</li>
<li>We promote learning and creativity in our communities, our nations, and our world. Imagination and technology are essential tools to build a better future.</li>
<li>We work to ensure that our own progress does not inhibit others. None of us can succeed at the expense of our fellow citizens.</li>
<li>We love what we do. We share it with others and, in so doing, will not only drive our innovation, but also bring peace through collaboration.</li>
</ul>
