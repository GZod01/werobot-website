## Our interview on bpmlaradio

On June 10, 2024, 3 members of our team were lucky enough to be interviewed and put on the radio ! Louise, Timoth√© and Franck travelled to Vernon to the premises of radio bpm, where the interview took place.

Our appearance was part of the radio station's "Association of the Week" section, so we were able to raise awareness of We Robot and its future projects, such as the First Global Challenge 2024 in Athens.

This interview was an opportunity to learn a little more about the association, its history and to explain in more detail the competitions in which we were able to take part.

But we won't tell you any more, as you can listen to our interview below !
