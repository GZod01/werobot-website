Once again this year, we will attend "Trophées de robotique" (national part of Eurobot Junior).

This contest is very fun one with a robot wire-controlled and optionaly an autonomous one.

Last year was our first attempt as a team and we ended 3rd at the regional contest. We were qualified for the national one but only ended 29th. We hope to do much better this year.

Last week we had our first brainstorming about our strategy and our design. Today we began to build the field and to try some ideas. What a pleasure to be together again with our robots !!
