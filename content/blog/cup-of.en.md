Hi everyone,

We wanted to be in the "Cup of" of the week but unfortunatly we came with this idea a bit late.

Once our video done, we submitted it to Khadijah but she told us that all the "Cup of" were ready and that ours could not be published before the competition.

So we decided to share it with you here.

The whole "Cup of" is in video and in french.

Subtitles were made by Quentin.

We hope you'll like it.
