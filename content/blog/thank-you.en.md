Following our May 15, 2024 visit to the <a href="https://www.skf.com/fr"> SKF</a> Mechatronics site in Saint-Marcel (27), which you can find on this <a href="https://werobot.fr/blog/we-robot-chez-skf"> article </a>, it is with great pleasure that we announce that SKF Group has become We Robot's first official sponsor! We're delighted with this partnership especially as SKF had already supported us in 2019 by helping to purchase our 3D printer.

These generous supporters are fully involved in the development and success of We Robot's future projects, such as the <i>FIRST</i> Global Challenge to be held from September 26 to 29, 2024 in Athens; a competition during which we will be responsible for promoting our sponsors internationally !


What's more, we're always coming across companies like Schneider Electric and Crédit Agricole who are ready to support us.
