## Learning how to use Python for programming.

What do you reckon they spend their days off on ??? They are learning !
Matthieu has defined what Aurélien and Pauline should focus on this week.

## Aurélien on listing.


Aurélien’s today's task :learn how to set up and use lists in Python programming. Applied intermediate phase : programming a  blurring algorythm in Python. When Aurélien will master the use of lists in Python programming, his skill will help for the ultimate Cherry robot.

## Pauline on data message commands.

As for Pauline,her last week programming must be improved.Pauline managed to pre-program Bobby, the test robot, so that it could move to the final stop at the right speed.It needed to define the  distance, then to make it turn at the precise spot and reach the exact stop.This week, Pauline is learning how to set up a user’s interface to monitor the robot from her PC keyboard while Bobby is moving to its goal.

## Surprise surprise!

Everybody was wracking their brains when Mohammed made a timely appearance to give Aurélien a helping hand !Thank you Mohammed!
