We began a brainstorming with the whole team today to build the roadmap of our next and last weeks.
We chose the spokesman and the captain of the team. It will be Quentin. 

Then we talked about the future design of our code ( pilot and co-pilot roles, threads and modes)

Finally we went to work because we have a hanging system to build and we're struggling with it.

We had a skype with Tom (@firstglobal) who confirmed that we should definetly gear up our motors.
So did we but we still have some problems because our axles tend to turn freely in the hex center of the pillows or the sprockets !!

We'll try to strengthen this.

If it doesn't work we might try to copy the system of team Oceania :-D
