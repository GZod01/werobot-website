## Four young programmers join TEAM FRANCE FGC Panama 2025

As every year, the students preparing to enter high school in September take the leap from the programming workshop to join Team We Robot. On their first day at the club, they start by disassembling the robot from the last FIRST Tech Challenge in order to get familiar with the REV Robotics equipment used in the FIRST Global Challenge. The experienced members guide the newcomers through their first screws and bolts, like Houda standing in the background.

Right after, the team builds a temporary holonomic base, which will be used by the programming group to learn Java. They plan to finish the base next Sunday. They know that to perform well in the competition, they’ll need to give it their all until the big day.

TEAM FRANCE is eagerly awaiting the announcement of the FGC 2025 challenge so they can start designing a competitive robot.
