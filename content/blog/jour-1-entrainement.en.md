But unfortunatly our robot was missing. We spent a lot of time looking for it until Mathis saw it at another team's pit !

Meanwhile, we met Team Latvia (Hi Danny !):

Having found our robot, it was time to get it out of its box :

Our two first rounds were not good at all. Hopefully, during the second one, the students met Team Greece and found them very friendly. It was the begining of socialization irl :-D

The last round was better so we felt quite confident even if we knew our robot was not really efficient.
