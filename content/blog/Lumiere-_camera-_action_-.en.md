## The new "social media" challenge

As part of the *FIRST* Global Challenge 2024 competition, which will be held in Athens from 26 to 29 September, we regularly have "social media challenges" to take on and slowly immerse ourselves in the competition that is coming up !

The latest challenge was to make a series of 49 clips, grouped into one video in which a team member is filmed giving a speech.

We had a script of the latter, and sometimes recommendations of movements to perform, in order to create creative transitions in the video. The final objective of the *FIRST* Global Challenge is to select country footage from around the world and group them into a single video.

This multicultural video is very symbolic, as it will be broadcast during the opening ceremony of the competition that will take place in the panathenaic stadium of Athens, where the first modern Olympic Games were held !

The video of Team France for this challenge is available right here !
