On the 29th and 30th of december 2018, the team We Robot was invited the  <a href="https://www.papavoine-menuiserie.com/"> Papavoine B. et D. </a> carpentry in Saint-Aubin sur Gaillon to build all  the pieces needed for the playground of the Troph√©es de robotique.

First, Bruno Papavoine taught the students the basics and then they became autonomous and efficient. Thanks to their complete involvement and to Bruno's help, they managed to finish 
it all in one day and a half. It was an unforgetable moment for our team.

We are very thankful to Bruno Papavoine and his company for the gracious and generous help they provided to our non-profit and we hope to meet him again for new adventures.
