Then Mathis built the second part of the PushBot, adding a an arm and a claw.

He then tried to program it after I explained how we could use the RightStickX and RightStickY variables.

On the video, the arm isn't programmed yet, but then Mathis didand it works !
Next step : trying to use the encoders to be more precise with the arm.
