## From October 29 to November 1, 2025, students from over 190 countries will gather in Panama City, Panama for the FIRST Global Challenge.
The young people and mentors of our robotics club are proud and happy to announce our selection for the Junior Robotics Olympics to be held this year in Panama City.

Furthermore, our good results in competition, the seriousness of our investment in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and the reliability of our club have enabled us to sign a 3-year commitment to the FGC 2025, FGC2026 and FGC 2027. This will make it easier for us to convince our sponsors, and give us more time to do so.
