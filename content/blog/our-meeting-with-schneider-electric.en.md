Our meeting with Schneider Electric on Monday, May 10, 2024 at Le Vaudreuil (27)

On Monday May 10, we were honored to be welcomed by Schneider Electric in their "Advanced Smart Factory" in Le Vaudreuil to present our project for our participation in the <i>FIRST</i>  Global Challenge 2024 in Athens, at the invitation of Christophe Ernis.

Initially, we met two employees on site, Christophe Ernis and Elyes Koeu, Smart Operation Manager and Industrial Transformation Project Manager respectively. We then met Virginie Rigaudeau, Sustainable Transformation Project Leader, and Emmanuel Morice, Site Director, who were able to attend our presentation by videoconference.

Our visit was divided into two parts; during the first half-hour we had the opportunity to present our association, from our beginnings to our next big project: The <i>FIRST</i> Global Challenge 2024, while answering questions about the running of the competitions and more. It was a real pleasure to talk to the employees, who were very curious about our project!


Following this presentation came the second part of our visit, that of discussing the terms of a possible partnership with Schneider Electric, which the site promised to look into. Indeed, Schneider Electric is a company committed to young people, as demonstrated by its status as a partner of the Challeng'Eure 4.0 robotics competition and Elyes Koeu's participation as a jury member.

We're also proud to say that our We Robot team was able to represent its colors by promoting the association and the project with enthusiasm and energy, a feat praised by the employees :) !

We'd like to thank Schneider Electric for their warm welcome, and Christophe Ernis for his kind hospitality. We'd also like to thank the employees present for taking the time to listen to us and discuss the project with our team. We look forward to future collaboration!
