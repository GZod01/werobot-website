## and has left a fabulous present in our stockings : deux brand new engines for the wheels. The Mecanum wheels will help the robot to move in all directions.

## Actually each wheel is coupled with its own engine. The  principle rests on the wheels  speeds : if both engines are computed to make the wheels move at equal speed , then the robot will move straight ahead.On the contrary , if the engines are computed to make each wheel move at its own speed, then the robot will move sideways.

## We will keep you informed of our crash tests when the engines and wheels will be assembled.
 Fun ahead !
