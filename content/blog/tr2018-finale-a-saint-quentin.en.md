Here we are, the national challenge. We passed the inspection et we're ready.

We have two matchs the first day and two others the second day. Maybe more if we qualify.

Our first match is so-so but we rank 30th out of 65... We can do better !

Our second match is, again, full of technical problem but we still score 143 which is not that bad.
But we are very disapointed because our robot can score 200 points quite easily !

We spend the evening at the bowling with the other teams.

Second day :

Third match at last satisfying : 199 points which make us jump from rank 27 to 21. We feel goood :-D

213 points for our fourth match (which is our record). We end up 20th out of 65 teams. We reached our goal and we are very proud...
We'lle do even better next year.
