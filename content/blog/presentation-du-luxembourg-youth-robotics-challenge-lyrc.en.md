For the first time <a href="https://www.makeit.lu"> Make It </a> from Luxembourg organize a national robotic competition in which they provide a robot kit.
We have been invited to this contest (thank you Marc :-D ) and we will be the only foreign team to attend to it.

Each team was lent a an <a href="https://www.makeblock.com/steam-kits/mbot-ultimate-2"> ultimate 2.0 </a> kit from MakeBlock and a RFID reader (from AdaFruit) and must build a robot out of it. The robot will have to detect boxes on the playground (thanks to RFID tags) and bring them back to its base. (More details on <a href="https://www.makeit.lu/?page_id=64"> the Make It website </a> )

Our students have begun to work on this project as soon as we finished the last competition.
Mathis and Mohamed designed the robot, they even have made a 3Dmodel of it, and then they built it.

Today, with Matthieu coming back from his holydays, we had our first tries and fixes. Then we began the code.
For now we have some issues with the bluetooth module.
