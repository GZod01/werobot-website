## Lucy, our COM editor, has honored us with an interview on the Lycée André Malraux radio station about our adventure at the FGC Athens 2024.

On Tuesday May 13, 2025, a new voice was heard in the corridors of the Lycée André-Malraux, in Gaillon (Eure) : that of “André Radio”, the station launched by and for students. Spearheaded by a dozen or so enthusiasts, this audacious project gives life to a rich program combining chronicles, investigations, reports, interviews and micro-trottoirs. Its ambition : to inform and entertain the school community.

Since the beginning of the year, these apprentice journalists have been devoting their Friday lunch breaks to shaping this genuine high-school medium. Their enthusiasm is contagious: over 200 students have contributed in one way or another to this collective adventure.

Lucy gave us the privilege of a fantastic report on our participation in the FIRST Global Challenge Athens 2024 Junior Olympics.
