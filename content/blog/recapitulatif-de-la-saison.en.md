It's been months since we last wrote something here. Here we go.
Like a large part of the world, the coronavirus stopped everything here. Nevertheless, we had some action !

## Les Trophées de Robotiques
We began the season working for "les trophées de robotique". We had two robots : an autonomous one and a driven one which was holonomic.

Then, because of a schedule issue we decided to give up "les trophées" to participate in ...

## La coupe de France de robotique

This is a whole new challenge for us because, there, all the robots must be autonomous. Moreover, our main robot being holonomics, our guys had to work hard to make it move autonomously.
They think about it during the lockdown period but, then, "la coupe" has been first cancelled then rescheduled to the end of October.
We're not sure yet that we'll be able to attend to it but this didn't prevent Mohamed and Matthieu to work on their robot during the whole summer holydays.
At the moment, they have a new robot, not holonomic anymore, with an opponent detection system to avoid collisions.

Everything have been cancelled.
