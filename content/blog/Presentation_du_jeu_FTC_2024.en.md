## The rules of the game for the First Tech Challenge 2024-2025

Beneath the ocean's surface lie our planet's most complex ecosystems, full of life and potential for exploration and learning, where every inhabitant has a role to play in building a thriving environment. This season, FIRST Tech Challenge teams will plunge their robots into the depths of the ocean to explore the unknown and reveal its wonders.
