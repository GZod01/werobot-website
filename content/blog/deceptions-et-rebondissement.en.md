Back from the US last summer, we thought we would attend to the next First Global Challenge to be held in Mexico.
For this purpose, we prepared a file to find sponsors.
We had the chance to get noticed by the GIGA (a local interprofessional group).

They invited us to their general assemby on the 1st of february. There, Mathis, Antoine and Quentin introduced our non-profit to all the CEOs and showed them our achievements so far and our projects.
The GIGA decided to help us to go to Mexico.
Moreover, one of their company ([holophane](http://www.holophane.fr/)), invited us to visit its factory in Les Andelys. There we discovered some production lines and we saw two robotic arms working.

Unfortunately, by the end of february,we've been noticed that we won't attend to FGC2018. Without any explanation, we haven't even been allowed to aplly for it or to qualify. We've been thrown away.

Hopefuly, the GIGA didn't let us down : they invited us back to their general assembly on the 14th of June. There we showed one of our robots working and they supported us with 5000€.

Some days later, we had a huge surprise :
we received a mail from China, inviting us to the World Adolescent Robotic Contest. Indeed, for its 18th edition, the WARC wanted to add a category : FGC. 15 chinese teams and 15 foreign teams would particpate with the FGC2017 rules. We were chosen to represent FRANCE

We don't have plenty of time to prepare and moreover, we have demantled our robot. Nevermind : this is even funnier to make another one and we already know the rules by heart !
So we're jumping into :
