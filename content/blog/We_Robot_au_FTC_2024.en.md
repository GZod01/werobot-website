**Our adventure at the FTC 2024**

On February 1, 2024, the We Robot team took part in the regional qualifiers for the First Tech Challenge (FTC) in Levallois-Perret (92)!

The day began with training sessions to prepare for our future matches in real-life conditions!

After that, we have to go through the inspection process to make sure our robot complies with the regulations :) 

**Phase 1: Qualifying** 

Once we've passed this stage, the serious business begins: we're about to play our first match, which will be just the start of a long series of victories !

In fact, we won all our matches with our alliances, which enabled us to move into first place in the standings, a position we hold after 5 matches in the first phase of the competition! 

**Phase 2: the play-offs

We Robot is now qualified for the second phase of the competition, the play-offs! We need to be strategic now to increase our chances of succeeding in this new challenge, as it's up to us to choose our next alliance. We've teamed up with the second-ranked team, the Ferdibot Team from Lyc√©e Ferdinand Buisson in Elbeuf (27), with whom we get on famously!

This great collaboration was more than fruitful: together, we won our last 3 matches and even achieved our best score of the competition: 108 points won against 46 for the opposing team !

Our two teams were awarded the FTC trophy, which opens the door to the national FTC competition to be held on March 22, 2025 in Lyon, where we hope to achieve the same success !
